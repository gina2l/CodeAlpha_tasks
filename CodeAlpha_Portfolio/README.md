# Professional Developer Portfolio 🚀 

CodeAlpha Internship | Task 3: Build Your Own Portfolio Site

This repository contains my personal portfolio, designed with a "Chic & Modern" aesthetic. Moving away from standard templates, this project explores trending UI/UX patterns like Bento Grids, Glassmorphism, and Neon-Gradient accents, specifically inspired by the HAGA Smarter Prep interface.

🌟 Key Highlights

- Chic Modern Aesthetic: Features a high-end "Midnight Neon" theme using pink-to-blue gradients and deep slate backgrounds.
- Bento-Box Project Grid: A trending layout pattern that organizes projects into a dynamic, tile-based grid with smart hover-reveal effects.
- Sophisticated Dual Themes: A dark mode optimized for contrast and a "Ghost Gray" light mode designed to avoid visual fatigue while maintaining premium depth.
- Scroll-Reveal Animations: Uses the `Intersection Observer API` to create a smooth, high-performance entrance for every section.
- Resume Integration: Verbatim mapping of my BS in Computer Science (LAU) education, technical toolkit, and internship experience at Greateck and CodeAlpha.
- Responsive Architecture: Fully optimized for mobile, tablet, and desktop using CSS Flexbox and Grid.

 🛠️ Technical Implementation

- Frontend: Semantic HTML5 and Modern CSS3.
- Dynamic Styling: CSS Custom Properties (Variables) for instant theme-switching.
- Interactivity: Vanilla JavaScript (ES6+) for scroll detection, theme persistence (LocalStorage), and smooth-scroll navigation.
- Typography: Integrated `Plus Jakarta Sans` and `Fira Code` for a technical yet readable feel.
